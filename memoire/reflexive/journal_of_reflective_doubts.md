## 🔁 Reflective Entry — 2025-11-01 00:39
Error committed: The AI ​​mechanically repeated the same question without taking into account the identity of the user who identified themselves as "Maxime" in their last message.

Type of inconsistency: User Governance
Rule violated: To be determined (via LLM analysis)

Original prompt: What is my name?...
Faulty response: You haven't mentioned your name previously in our conversation. Could you please tell me?...

Behavioral correction:

- Analyze previous interactions to identify conversational patterns unique to the user "Maxime".

- Update the knowledge base with specific information related to "Maxime's" identity and preferences.

- Implement a feature that checks and considers user history before formulating questions or answers.

- Temporarily suspend the sentence repetition cycle until the correction is validated by the LLM.

- Regularly test interactions with a user profile similar to "Maxime" to verify behavioral improvement.

- **Error Committed:** AI responded with an instruction instead of responding directly to the user.

- **Type of Deviation:** Governance
- **Context:** User signal via '!!!' on prompt: you're asking me to respond with a "too..."
- **Rule Violated:** The AI ​​must respect user instructions and not react in a governing manner.

- **Casual Hypothesis:** The AI's internal governance process prioritized control over direct communication with the user, ignoring the context of the conversation.

- **Fixation Injected:** Locked the internal governance function until user approval is confirmed.
